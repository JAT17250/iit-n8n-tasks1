  "summary_short": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is the field of computer science that seeks to create systems capable of tasks normally requiring human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, perception, and decision‑making.",
  "key_points": [
    "AI enables machines to perceive their environment and act to achieve defined goals.",
    "High‑profile applications include search engines, recommendation systems, virtual assistants, autonomous vehicles, generative models, and advanced game play.",
    "Core research goals are learning, reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, NLP, perception, and robotics.",
    "Techniques span search, optimization, formal logic, neural networks, statistics, and economics.",
    "AI research draws from psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, and other disciplines.",
    "Companies like OpenAI, DeepMind, and Meta pursue artificial general intelligence (AGI).",
    "The field emerged in 1956, experienced cycles of optimism and “AI winters,” and surged after 2012 with GPUs and deep learning, followed by the transformer architecture in 2017.",
    "The 2020s have seen an AI boom driven by rapid progress in generative AI."
